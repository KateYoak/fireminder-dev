# Spaced Repetition

## The Science of Memory

Your brain forgets things on a predictable curve. By reviewing at the right moments, you can **dramatically** improve retention with minimal effort.

## How It Works

1. **New information** decays quickly
2. Each **review** strengthens the memory
3. The more reviews, the **slower the decay**
4. Eventually, knowledge becomes permanent

## Why Fibonacci?

Traditional systems use arbitrary multipliers. Fireminder uses the Fibonacci sequence:

- **Natural progression**: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21...
- **Self-similar**: Each step feels proportional
- **Proven**: Mirrors natural growth patterns

## Research

Spaced repetition was discovered by **Hermann Ebbinghaus** in 1885 and has been validated by decades of cognitive science research.
