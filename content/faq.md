# Frequently Asked Questions

## What is Fireminder?

Fireminder is a **spaced repetition** app that helps you remember anything. It uses Fibonacci intervals to schedule reviews at optimal times.

## How does spaced repetition work?

Spaced repetition is based on the **forgetting curve**. You review items just before you'd forget them, strengthening memory each time. Learn more in [Spaced Repetition](#spaced-repetition).

## What are Fibonacci intervals?

Instead of fixed intervals, Fireminder uses the Fibonacci sequence: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21... This naturally spaces out reviews as you master material.

## How do I get started?

Check out [Getting Started](#getting-started) for a quick walkthrough.

## Can I use different time units?

Yes! Each deck can use hours, days, weeks, months, or years as its base unit.

## What happens if I miss reviews?

Fireminder uses **overdue decay** - if you're very overdue, it adjusts your interval down to help you catch up without losing progress.
